time LIFE() { 

    time someEvent; 

    for (someEvent = birth; someEvent < death; ++someEvent) { 

     Ego: I am always right. 

     No. You are biased. You could be wrong. You are probably always wrong. 

    Ego: I am special. 

    Maybe. You could be special in one dimension, 
    but you just can’t be special in all dimensions. 
    Even Bill Gates can’t. He’s extremely rich, extremely smart, extremely nerdy, extremely lucky, 
    but he’s not extreme in terms of relationship, food preference, and communication skills, etc.. 
    What’s wrong with being common and having some common human experiences? 

     Ego: I want to be somebody. I want to be BIG. 

    Well good, good. But you are stopping me from achieving it. 
    This idea is obsessive, delusional, counterproductive and toxic sometimes, 
    and for the worse it never goes away! 

   Ego: Me! Me! Me! Give more attention to ME! Feed Me!

   Enough! Enough is enough. 
   I am gonna ignore you, starve you, abandon you, and pay attention to something else. 
   I mean ANYTHING but you, my dear ego. 

   Ego: NO! Stay with me! I am you, and you are me. We are TOGETHER! 

   I hope we are not. I may still love you but let’s keep some distance. 
   Let me do some real work without you . 

   Ego: But…. 

   Oh just SHUT UP! I am working! 

   Silence, peace unfolding.. 

   Work done. Satisfied. Happy. 

     My dear ego jumps out and hits my head! 

   Ego: Hello! It’s ME again! I am GREAT and SOOOOO Worthwhile! 

     Oh, you prick! We are going back again, right? 

   } 

return EXIT_FAILURE;
